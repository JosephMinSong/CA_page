# Cancer Guide, Helper, and Symptom Tracker

### Dealing with cancer is incredibly hard; navigating through serious life changes because of cancer shouldn't require extensive, hour-long searching on the internet or paperwork.
### Project built with Python, Flask, Jinja2, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

I long have been passionate about the medical field and have a great desire to contribute to medicine, even through software engineering.
This project aims to serve a specific group of cancer diagnoses: leukemia and other blood-related cancers.

This section of my website allows registered users to create and update symptoms that relate to their diagnosis or condition. This way, all of their notes can be access in one, secure place that they may reference.
